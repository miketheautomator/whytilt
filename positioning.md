We built AI agents that use real desktops and browsers to do tasks normally handled by entry- or mid-level employees - QA testing, analytics validation, data scraping, admin work, and more.

They follow plain-English instructions, not code. No headless browsers, no DOM hooks - just real clicks, typing, and file use.

You can install them on Mac, Windows, Linux, or deploy them on-prem to keep data and credentials local.

We train and host our own model, which costs us 80% less to run than Anthropic Sonnet 4, and lets us charge customers 20% less.

At $200/month per customer in model usage, we earn 80% profit margins - even at scale.
